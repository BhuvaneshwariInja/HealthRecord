# Health Record
 This problem involves a mix of software design, database management, security, and performance optimization, making it a complex and challenging task within the healthcare domain

 This code provides a basic foundation for managing patients and their medical records. In a real-world scenario, you would need to expand and refine this code to include appointment scheduling, billing, security, and other features described in the original problem statement. Additionally, you would likely use a database to persist the data and implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
